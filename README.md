# RomCom  
### Abstract:
This is a user-friendly app that displays romance novel covers. Users can generate random covers with the click of a button. If they like the cover made, they can save that cover to their favorites library. Adding to the interactivity, a user can input their own image URL, title, and taglines to make their very own unique cover.
The features included are:
- The ability to randomly generate a romance cover
- The ability to navigate between views
- The ability to create a unique cover
- The ability to save user created and randomly generated covers
### Installation Instructions:
- Git clone this repo to your local machine
- Cd into that directory
- Enter the command open index.html to open the browser
- Have fun looking at romance book covers and making your own!

### Context:
We spent 25 hours working on this project. We are in week two of Mod 1.

### Learning Goals:
- Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
- Ensure that all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript
Build out functionality using functions that follow SRP
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded: adding, removing, and updating elements, first in the Data Model and then on the DOM
- Deepen our understanding of the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Write code collaboratively
- Practice reading and understanding code written by other team members
- Document changes with atomic commits and code reviews during standups


### Wins:
- We each brought different strengths to the project, which gave each of us an opportunity to reinforce our knowledge and learn new techniques. We really enjoyed our workflow and being able to hold each other accountable for breaks and dividing the workload. Great partnering :) 
- Practicing and enacting good pseudocode was an excellent experience in being able to create a problem-solving framework.
- In addition to researching when we were stuck, we revisited various lessons including the Intro the DOM and HTML to better understand the concepts and also reinforced our network within Turing by reaching out to mentors, fellow students and cohort members.
- We became better at troubleshooting by using console.log, inspecting elements in Dev Tools and a little chatGPT to draw on our existing knowledge to formulate our questions effectively. Using these tools really helped us with our rubber-ducking skills and we reflected that we got quicker and improved through the course of the project.

### Challenges:
- Initially learning how to merge and manage pull requests to our cloned copy rather than merging into the main Turing branch and learning how to reverse that.
- Managing the abstraction of objects and the data model, removing and adding classes, dialing back our mess and making it more scalable with helper functions.
- Iteration 2 took the most time and we had to spend more energy reworking it past our benchmark calendared times to achieve good progress.
- We did a lot of learning through the process of getting the make my book page to create unique user generated covers. We even made a jamboard to model and diagram to better visualize how to access data and model it in thru the DOM.
